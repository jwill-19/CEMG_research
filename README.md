# Examining Future Changes in Tropical Cylone Behavior Near Landfall
Analysis of tropical cyclone (TC) count/frequency, intensity, and translation speed in the North Atlantic basin based on historical observations, historical simulations, and future simulations in Python. Packages used include NumPy, Matplotlib, Xarray, SciPy, GeoPandas, and Shapely.  

### Abstract

Tropical cyclones (TCs) are some of the most dangerous weather events in the world, and it is important to understand potential changes in their behavior due to future climate change. In this project, the intensity, frequency, and translation speed of TCs near landfall (within 100, 200, and 300 km) were analyzed. The datasets used in this analysis were IBTrACS (historical estimation of observed TCs from 1985-2014), REF (Community Atmosphere Model version 5 -CAM5- simulation for 1985-2014), RCP4.5 (CAM5 in a future climate for 2070-2100), and RCP8.5 (same as RCP4.5 but with a higher rate of warming). Additionally, three models from the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) were analyzed. These models (HadGEM, CNRM, EC-Earth) contained both past simulations (1985-2014) and future simulations (2021-2050). Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests at the 5% significance level were conducted to compare intensity and translation speed distributions of past simulations to the future simulations. The distributions of all intensities, maximum intensity, average intensity, and translation speed were analyzed. For all intensities, there were statistically significant decreases in RCP4.5, RCP8.5, HadGEM, and CNRM and increases in EC-Earth. For maximum intensities, there were statistically significant decreases in RCP8.5. For average intensities, there were mixed results in RCP8.5 and statistically significant increases in EC-Earth. For translation speed, there were statistically significant increases in all models along with decreases in HadGEM and CNRM. REF estimated IBTrACS well in terms of frequency, but significantly underestimated it near land. TC frequency decreased in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 simulations. HadGEM and CNRM were accurate in the North Atlantic basin, but had mixed results in coastal regions. EC-Earth severely underestimated frequencies in all regions. HighResMIP future simulations showed mixed results. This work was supported with funding from Undergraduate Research & Creative Activities (URECA) and the U.S. Department of Energy.
